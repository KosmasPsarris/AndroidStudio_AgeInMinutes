## Some more info:
- This project was created in Android Studio/Kotlin.
- There are plenty of comments inside the codes files to help with the understanding of the code.
- This repository was created to help others in need but also to show my experience.
- If you do not wish to download and run the whole project (.rar), you may only look into the code files which are also included in the .rar file.
- This application's code is a variation of the code/logic of a course from Denis Panjuta https://www.udemy.com/user/denispanjuta/. I do not mean to take credit for his amazing work, only learn and experiment.
